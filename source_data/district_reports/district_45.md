<thinking>This district is represented by a Republican incumbent, Sharon Cooper. She won her last two elections by a comfortable margin. The district is majority white, wealthy, well-educated, and has shifted towards the Democratic Party since 2010, though not by a significant margin. The Democratic Party should focus on mobilizing the existing base, persuading moderate Republicans, and targeting the growing Asian and Hispanic populations. A strong candidate with a focus on economic issues and education would be most competitive. Given Cooper's incumbency and the district's overall demographics, allocating resources elsewhere might be more strategic.</thinking>
