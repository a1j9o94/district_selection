#### State legislative maps enacted in 2023

Governor Kemp (R) signed revised legislative maps into law on December 8, 2023. Legislators in the Georgia House of Representatives voted 98-71 to adopt the new state legislative maps on December 5. The Georgia State Senate voted 32-23 to adopt the state legislative maps on December 1. For more information about the enacted legislative maps, [click here.](#Drafts_and_proposals)

[\[6\]](#cite_note-Twitter-6)

On October 26, 2023, the [United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia](/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Northern_District_of_Georgia "United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia")
 ruled that the state's congressional and legislative district boundaries violated the Voting Rights Act and enjoined the state from using them for future elections.[\[7\]](#cite_note-Reuters-7)
 The court directed the [Georgia General Assembly](/Georgia_General_Assembly "Georgia General Assembly")
 to develop new maps by December 8, 2023.[\[7\]](#cite_note-Reuters-7)

##### Reactions to 2023 state legislative maps

On December 20, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District decided to uphold the maps enacted on November 30 and found them in compliance with the Voting Rights Act.

The plaintiffs from the October 26 case objected to the maps and asked the court to draw new voting districts in time for the 2024 congressional and legislative elections:[\[8\]](#cite_note-gpb-8)

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| “   | "The inescapable conclusion is that the proposed plans do not come close to following the court's order. Putting eyes on the 2023 proposed plans confirms the total failure of compliance. ...<br><br>The General Assembly's attempt to minimize and zero out minority voting opportunity in a purported 'remedy' to the state's Section 2 violation is precisely the sort of gamesmanship Section 2 was meant to stamp out. ...<br><br>The General Assembly's purported remedy makes a mockery of that process, the court's ruling and the Voting Rights Act, and reflects the state's continued refusal to afford minority voters equal opportunity to participate in electoral politics."[\[8\]](#cite_note-gpb-8)<br>[\[9\]](#cite_note-quotedisclaimer-9) | ”   |
